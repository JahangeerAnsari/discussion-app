This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

<!-- About this project  -->
<!-- 
Discord is a free communication platform designed for creating communities. It combines features of voice, video, and text chat, allowing users to communicate in real-time. Originally popular among gamers for coordinating gameplay, Discord has since expanded its user base to include various online communities, such as study groups, fan clubs, and work teams.

Key Features:
Servers and Channels: Users can create or join servers, which are like chat rooms or communities. Each server can have multiple text or voice channels, each dedicated to specific topics or activities.
Voice and Video Calls: Users can engage in voice calls, video calls, and screen sharing within channels or through direct messages.
Text Chat: Text channels allow for structured conversations, with support for images, GIFs, and custom emojis.
Bots and Integrations: Discord supports bots, which are automated programs that can manage tasks, provide information, or entertain users. It also integrates with other platforms like Twitch, YouTube, and more.
Customizable: Users can customize their servers with roles, permissions, and various settings to control access and functionality.
Discord is available on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and through web browsers.
